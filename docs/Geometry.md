### Introduction and Overview
Explore the nature of variational problem, and some idea in modern logic; show their connections
#### Reflections on Light
* Isoperimetric problem: the Greeks reasoned about it inductively. Regular n-sided polydgons have the
largest perimeter for a given area, so circle (the limit) must have the largest amongst all closed shapes.
* Fermat's solution to the problem of refraction: light travels along the path of least time. It is a  
  variational (minimize/maximize a qualtity) solution to the problem of tracing rays in a system of 
  inhomogeneous media.  
#### Variational Problems
* This was formalized and generalized in mechanism using Hamilton's principle that a system will evolve 
  in a way to minimize the 'total' (integral of) the difference between kinetic and potential energies.
* "Indeed, straight lines are themselves solutions to a variational problem." Geodesic: the path of 
  least action.
* Dirichlet principle: distribution of heat in a homogeneous body minimizes an "energy functional" 
(function of functions defined on the body). Hence, minimal surfaces instead of paths.
#### The Best is Often Beautiful
* Symmetry, beauty...
* 'The "best" way to find interesting configurations is to define a natural functional and show that
  extrema (exist and) are often the objects sought after'
* _Problem_: Suppose one has 2n points in the plane, no three colinear, n blue and n red. Show that it 
  is possible to find n line segments who endpoints are each one red and one blue, so that the 
  segments do not intersect.
