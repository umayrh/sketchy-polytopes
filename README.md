## Why mono repository?

Architecturally, microservices are easier to deploy, manage, and scale. This deployment paradigm is aided by code that is modularized for re-use while being written,
or rewritten, documented, tested, and bundled in a consistent manner. In particular, using a single project management tool, where possible, allows clearly mapping dependencies across code 
modules. All this is easier achieved with a mono repo at the acceptable cost of wider clones.
